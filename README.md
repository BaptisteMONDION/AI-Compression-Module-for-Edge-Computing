# AI Compression Module for Edge Computing

## Project Overview

This project aims to study and implement techniques for compressing AI models used in edge computing environments. The objective is to optimize the performance of these models, reducing memory consumption and energy usage, making them more efficient for deployment on edge devices with limited resources.

The edge devices in this project are typically low-power, resource-constrained platforms, such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, or similar devices. These devices are often used for real-time AI inference tasks like object detection, image classification, and sensor data analysis, but their limited resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) require careful optimization to run AI models effectively.

## Key Objectives

1. **Model Compression Techniques**: Implement and test various model compression methods, including:
   - Pruning
   - Quantization
   - Knowledge distillation
   - Low-rank factorization
   - Weight sharing

2. **Energy Efficiency**: Analyze how model compression impacts energy consumption, aiming to achieve a significant reduction in energy usage for AI tasks on edge devices.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on minimizing inference time while maximizing model accuracy after compression, ensuring that models remain viable for real-time edge computing tasks.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: Evaluate memory consumption before and after applying compression techniques, aiming to reduce the model's memory footprint to fit within the limited resources of edge devices.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Edge Devices**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano or similar low-power edge computing devices.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Power monitoring tools (e.g., INA3221) for measuring energy consumption.
- **Network**: Local network to test multiple edge devices, using TCP/IP or UDP protocols for communication between devices if necessary.

## Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or similar Linux-based OS).
- **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other relevant frameworks for model development and deployment.
- **CUDA**: Required for GPU acceleration (if available on the edge device).
- **Compression Libraries**: TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit, PyTorch Compression, or custom solutions for pruning, quantization, etc.
- **Monitoring and Visualization**: Prometheus, Grafana for performance monitoring and visualization.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup and Installation

1. **Set Up Edge Devices**:
   - Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on each edge device (Jetson Nano).
   - Connect the devices to the local network.
   - Install power monitoring sensors (if applicable) to monitor energy consumption during inference tasks.

2. **Prepare the Central Server (Optional for Multi-Device Setup)**:
   - Set up a central server with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring multiple devices.
   - Install necessary libraries for communication with the edge devices.

### Phase 2: Model Compression Techniques Implementation

1. **Pruning**:
   - Implement a pruning algorithm that removes weights with small magnitudes or neurons that are less important.
   - Use TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit or PyTorch methods to prune the models.
   
2. **Quantization**:
   - Quantize the models to use lower precision (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit integers) to reduce memory usage.
   - Evaluate the trade-off between performance and accuracy after quantization.

3. **Knowledge Distillation**:
   - Implement a teacher-student model setup where a smaller student model learns from a larger teacher model, preserving accuracy while reducing size.

4. **Low-Rank Factorization and Weight Sharing**:
   - Explore methods like matrix decomposition and weight sharing to further reduce the memory footprint of the model.

### Phase 3: Performance Testing

1. **Energy Consumption**:
   - Measure energy consumption of the original and compressed models during inference tasks.
   - Analyze the reduction in energy usage after compression.

2. **Inference Time**:
   - Benchmark the inference time of the original and compressed models to assess the impact on real-time performance.

3. **Model Accuracy**:
   - Test the accuracy of the compressed models and compare it to the original models, ensuring that compression does not significantly degrade performance.

4. **Memory Usage**:
   - Monitor memory usage and the size of the model before and after compression to ensure that the memory footprint is reduced.

### Phase 4: Optimization and Deployment

1. **Optimize for Real-Time Use**:
   - Optimize model inference for edge computing platforms, ensuring that both performance and energy efficiency are maximized.

2. **Deploy on Edge Devices**:
   - Deploy the compressed models on edge devices and evaluate them in real-world scenarios.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Final Deployment

1. **Documentation**:
   - Document the process of installing, configuring, and testing the models, including any troubleshooting steps.

2. **Final Deployment**:
   - Deploy the final models on edge devices for continuous use and monitor their performance.

## Expected Outcomes

- Reduced memory usage and energy consumption for AI models deployed on edge devices.
- Retained or improved inference speed, making it feasible to run AI models in real-time on constrained devices.
- A set of practical guidelines and best practices for optimizing AI models in edge computing environments.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: Secure the communication between edge devices and central servers using SSL/TLS.
- **Access Control**: Use SSH and other secure methods for accessing edge devices and the central server.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the compressed models do not lose critical performance features or data integrity.
